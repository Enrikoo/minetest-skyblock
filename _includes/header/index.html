            <h2>What is Skyblock?</h2>
            
            <p>Skyblock is a Minetest game where the world is mostly empty at first except for a small floating island.</p>

            <p>You start out standing on the island. Your rank is Level 1. There are 10 quests to complete. 
                When a quest is achieved, you get a reward. When all 10 quests are achieved, you are 
                promoted to Level 2 and given new quests with new rewards.</p>

            <p>Finish the Level 2 quests, and there is a Level 3. Finish Level 3 and you graduate as a Skyblock 
                Master. You are granted <strong>Fly</strong> and <strong>Fast</strong> privileges and may build 
                what you wish.</p>

                    <h2>Quests and Feats</h2>
                    
                    <p>Your current quests are listed in your Inventory (press <code>I</code>). Feats (completed quests) are indicated. The Inventory also includes hints in the form of small node icons. If you click those, they will show you how to craft associated items.</p>

                    <p>On the islands where you start, or where you are respawned, the quest block will appear. It looks like <code>?</code>. If you or other players punch these (left or right click), your quests and feats are listed there for everybody to view.</p>

                    <p>You can also use quest blocks to start over. To do so, dig one of them using long left click. This will send you all the way back to the start. You will lose your feats and items, and will have to restart from Level 1.  You will get to keep the structures you have created including chests.</p>
